# Corynth: Automation as Code

Corynth is a declarative automation framework that allows you to define, manage, and execute complex automation workflows as code. Similar to how Terraform manages infrastructure, Corynth manages automation tasks through human-readable configuration files, enabling version control, collaboration, and reusability of automation processes.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Declarative Configuration**: Define the "what" not the "how" of automation
2. **Human-Readable**: Simple, intuitive syntax for non-programmers
3. **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible through a robust plugin system
4. **Idempotency**: Run configurations multiple times without side effects
5. **State Management**: Track the state of automation tasks
6. **Modularity**: Build reusable components and templates

## Installation

```bash
# Install from source
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/corynth.git
cd corynth
go build -o corynth cmd/corynth/main.go
sudo mv corynth /usr/local/bin/
```

Quick Start
